The embed-resources component will make your final rendered `html` self-contained.\n\n\n\n\n\n    ::: {.cell}\n    \n    ```{.r .cell-code}\n    ---\n    title: \"Document title\"\n    author: \"my name\"\n    format:\n      html:\n    embed-resources: true\n    ---\n    ```\n    :::\n\n\n\n\n\n# Instructions\n\nBe sure to include the relevant R code as well as full sentences answering each of the questions (i.e. if I ask for the average, you can output the answer in R but **also** write a full sentence with the answer). Be sure to frequently save your files!\n\nData for the homework will be in the STA363_inst_files -> data folder.\n\n# Exercises\n\nAll problems are from {{< var course.text >}}. Abbreviated BMLR. \n\n- Conceptual 1B\n- Conceptual2a-d\n- Conceptual Number 3\n- Guided Number 3\n \nPlease do not give them new numbers. If you want to be brief, use a code such as C1B for the first problem. \n\n# Submission\n\nWhen you are finished with your homework, be sure to Render the final document. Once rendered, you can download your file by:\n\n-   Finding the .html file in your File pane (on the bottom right of the screen)\n-   Click the check box next to the file\n-   Click the blue gear above and then click \"Export\" to download\n-   Submit your final html document to the respective assignment on [Moodle]({{< var course.moodle >}})\n\n\n\n",
