It will be named something like *hw-02_LAST_NAME.qmd*.\n\n-   Then you need to save your copy. Click *File -\\> Save as -\\> Navigate to the folder `STA364_Projects` (that we share) -\\> Change the \"LAST_NAME part of the file name to your last name -\\> Save*.\n\n-   Update the top of the document, called the `YAML,` with your name.\n\n# Homework Instructions\n\nBe sure to include the relevant R code and complete sentences answering each question (e.g., if I ask for the average, you can output the answer in R but **also** write a complete sentence with the answer). Be sure to save your files frequently!\n\nData for the homework will be in the STA364_inst_files -\\> data folder.\n\n# Exercises\n\n## Reading\n\nRead [fpp3](https://otexts.com/fpp3/what-can-be-forecast.html) 2.7-2.9.\n\n## Problems\n\n### Question 1\n\nExplore the following four time series: *Bricks* from `aus_production`, *Lynx* from `pelt`, *Close* from `gafa_stock`, and *Demand* from `vic_elec`.\n\na.  Use ? (or help()) to find out about the data in each series.\nb.  What is the time interval of each series?\nc.  Use `autoplot()` to produce a time plot of each series.\nd.  For the last plot, modify the axis labels and title. See the `labs()` function.\n\n### Question 2 (fpp3)\n\ni.  Create a data folder inside your STA364 project folder. Go to RStudio and navigate to your STA364Project folder in the *files* tab on the bottom right. Click *New Folder* and name the folder *data*.\n\nii. Now, you need to copy the data from the instructor data folder to a data folder in your folder. Go to the STA364_inst_files folder and into the data folder\n\niii. Check the box next to `tute.csv`, then *More*, then *Copy to...*, and save the file in your newly created data folder.\n\nThe first chunk below reads `tute1.csv` into R and then shows the data with the `View()` function. You should find four columns of information. Columns B through D each contain a quarterly series labeled Sales, AdBudget, and *GDP*. *Sales* contains the quarterly sales for a small company over the period 1981-2005. *AdBudget* is the advertising budget, and *GDP* is the gross domestic product. All series have been adjusted for inflation.\n\nYou can read the data into R with the following script:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntute1 <- readr::read_csv(\"data/tute1.csv\")\nView(tute1)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nThen converts the data to a time series object in R (tsibble).\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmytimeseries <- tute1 |>\n  mutate(Quarter = yearquarter(Quarter)) |>\n  as_tsibble(index = Quarter)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nThen construct the time series plot for the *Sales* series.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmytimeseries |>\n  autoplot(Sales)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\na.  Use this code to generate a time series plot for the other two series in the data, *AdBudget*, and *GDP*.\nb.  Compare and contrast the three series.\n\n### Question 3 (fpp4)\n\nThe `USgas` package contains data on the demand for natural gas in the US.\n\na.  Install the `USgas` package. (Use `install.packages('package_name')`). Then to use it you will need `library(package_name)`.\nb.  Create a tsibble from `us_total` with *year* as the index and *state* as the key.\nc.  Plot the annual natural gas consumption by state for the New England area (comprising the states of Maine, Vermont, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Connecticut and Rhode Island).\n\n### Question 4 (fpp6)\n\nThe `aus_arrivals` data set comprises quarterly international arrivals to Australia from Japan, New Zealand, the UK, and the US. It is available after you call in the `fpp3` package.\n\na.  Use `autoplot()`, `gg_season()` and `gg_subseries()` to compare the differences between the arrivals from these four countries.\n\nb.  Can you identify any unusual observations?\n\n# Submission\n\nWhen you are finished with your homework, be sure to Render the final document. Once rendered, you can download your file by:\n\n-   Finding the .html file in your File pane of RStudio (on the bottom right of the screen)\n-   Click the check box next to the file\n-   Click the blue gear above and then click \"Export\" to download\n-   Submit your final HTML document to the respective assignment on [Moodle]({{< var course.moodle >}})\n",
