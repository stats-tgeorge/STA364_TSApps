I want to be a resource for you. \n-   I (like many people) am still in the process of learning about diverse perspectives and identities. If something was said in class (by anyone) that made you feel uncomfortable, please talk to me about it.\n:::\n\n\n\n## Collaboration policy {.smaller}\n\n-   Only work that is clearly assigned as team work should be completed collaboratively.\n\n-   Some labs/activities will be completed in groups.\n    You **should** work with each other during, and sometimes outside of class, to complete the labs.\n\n-   Homework must be submitted individually.\n    You may **not** directly share answers / code with others, however you are welcome to discuss the problems in general and ask for advice.\n\n-   Exams must be completed individually.\n    You may **not** discuss any aspect of the exam with peers.\n    If you have questions, email me, especially if you get stuck on an usual problem (not a coding error).\n\n## Sharing / reusing code policy {.smaller}\n\n-   I are aware that a huge volume of code is available on the web, and many tasks may have solutions posted.\n\n-   Unless explicitly stated otherwise, this course's policy is that may make use of any online resources (e.g. RStudio Community, StackOverflow, etc.) but you must ***explicitly cite*** where you obtained any code you directly use or use as inspiration in your solution(s). Often on exams, I will require you use code provided in class. \n\n-   Any recycled code that is discovered and is not explicitly cited will be treated as plagiarism, regardless of source\n\n-   You do not need to cite code I provide in class or in the notes. \n\n## Five tips for success\n\n1.  Complete all the preparation work before class (readings).\n\n2.  Ask questions.\n\n3.  Do the readings.\n\n4.  Do the labs/activities.\n\n4.  Do the Homework\n\n6.  Donâ€™t procrastinate!
