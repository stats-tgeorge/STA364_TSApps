    "section": "AI Policy",
    "text": "AI Policy\nThe beta release of Dall-E-Mini in July 2022 and ChatGPT in November 2022 are among many tools using artificial intelligence. There is a good possibility that using tools like these are going to become an important skill for careers in the not distant future (https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jan/07/chatgpt-bot-excel-ai-chatbot-tech).\nIn the meantime though, it‚Äôs going to take a while for society to figure out when using these tools is/isn‚Äôt acceptable.\nWork created by AI tools may not be considered original work and, instead, considered automated plagiarism. It is derived from previously created texts from other sources that the models were trained on, yet doesn‚Äôt cite sources. AI models have built-in biases (ie, they are trained on limited underlying sources; they reproduce, rather than challenge, errors in the sources) AI tools have limitations (ie, they lack critical thinking to evaluate and reflect on criteria; they lack abductive reasoning to make judgments with incomplete information at hand; they make up or use inaccurate information and may ‚Äúhallucinate‚Äù sources that do not exist)\nIn this course, all informal writing should be written without the use of AI. The purpose of informal writing is to help you think through your ideas, connect with your lived experiences, and to figure out your thoughts and opinions. Using AI here subverts that process.\nA final note: Other courses may have different AI policies, and it is important to be aware of the policy in each class.\n\nDISABILITIES AND ACCOMODATIONS POLICY\nCornell College makes reasonable accommodations for persons with disabilities. Students should notify the Office of Academic Support and Advising and their course instructor of any disability related accommodations within the first three days of the term for which the accommodations are required, due to the fast pace of the block format. For more information on the documentation required to establish the need for accommodations and the process of requesting the accommodations.\n\n\nACADEMIC HONESTY POLICY\nCornell College expects all members of the Cornell community to act with academic integrity. An important aspect of academic integrity is respecting the work of others. A student is expected to explicitly acknowledge ideas, claims, observations, or data of others, unless generally known. When a piece of work is submitted for credit, a student is asserting that the submission is her or his work unless there is a citation of a specific source. If there is no appropriate acknowledgment of sources, whether intended or not, this may constitute a violation of the College‚Äôs requirement for honesty in academic work and may be treated as a case of academic dishonesty. The procedures regarding how the College deals with cases of academic dishonesty appear in The Catalog, under the heading ‚ÄúAcademic Honesty.‚Äù\n\n\nIllness Policy\nIf you are experiencing COVID-19 symptoms, do not attend class. Perform a home test or contact Director of Student Health Services Lynn O‚ÄôBrien at student_health@cornellcollege.edu immediately to arrange a COVID-19 test at the Health Center. If you need to isolate due to COVID-19, or if you become unable to attend class for any other health reason, contact me as soon as possible to determine if you are able to continue in the class. A Withdrawal for Health Reasons may be required.\n\n\nMandatory Reporter Reminder\nIt is my goal that you feel supported and able to share information related to your life experiences during classroom discussions, in your written work, and in any one-on-one meetings with me. You should also know that all Cornell College faculty and staff are mandatory reporters. This means that I will keep information you share with me private to the greatest extent possible. However, I am required to share information regarding sexual assault, abuse, criminal behavior, or about a student who may be a danger to themselves or to others. If you wish to speak to someone confidentially who is not a mandatory reporter, you can schedule an appointment with one of the counselors in the Ebersole Health and Wellbeing Center or contact the College Chaplain, Rev.¬†Melea White, at mwhite@cornelllcollege.edu.",
