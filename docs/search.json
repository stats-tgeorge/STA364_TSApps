    "text": "Instructor\nDr. Tyler George\n   Cornell College, West 311\n    tgeorge@cornellcollege.edu \n\n\n\nClass Meetings\nJanuary 13th to February 5th\n   9:00 am - 11:00 am and 1:00 pm - 3:00 pm\n   West 213\n\n\n\nOffice Hours\n   MWTh 3:05pm-4:05pm and by appt.\n   West 311\n   Optional Appointment\n\n\n\n\nYou Are A Priority\nMy goal for this block is to help you learn the material. I want to first and foremost recognize that you are an individual and thus are unique and may learn uniquely. Additionally, your health and well-being are priority one. Learning cannot happen effectively if you don’t meet your other personal needs. That all being said, I have structured the class in a way that I, from experience teaching and learning myself, think will be most beneficial for most students. I promise to do my best to create an inclusive and engaging learning environment. I ask that you keep an open line of communication between us when you need help and/or flexibility. You and your learning are why I am here.\n\n\nCourse Description\nTime series analysis is a vital tool for investigating data from many fields, such as business, economics, engineering, biology, medicine, social sciences, and politics. Understanding and anticipating a variable’s change over time is valuable. This class will cover an array of time series methods, including those for correlation analysis and forecasting, stochastic models, regression analysis with time-related variables, and stationary/nonstationary models.\n\n\nLearning Objectives\nThis course supports the Educational Priorities and Outcomes of Cornell College, emphasizing knowledge, communication, and reasoning. Specifically, the learning objectives of this course are:\n\nAbility to communicate statistical ideas clearly and accurately (communication).\nUnderstand what a time series is (knowledge, reasoning).\nUnderstand forecasting strategies (knowledge, reasoning).\nUnderstand regression with time-related variables (knowledge, reasoning).\nLearn and apply some advanced time series methods (knowledge, reasoning).\nAbility to ascertain which type of analysis is appropriate for a particular data set and question (reasoning, ethical behavior).\nBecome more adept at following the statistical process of starting with a question, collecting the requisite data, analyzing the data, and reporting on the results (reasoning, communication).\n\n\n\nPrerequisite\nTo be successful in this class, you should have completed STA 201 and STA 202.\n\n\nCourse Materials\nAll of the materials for this class are free.\nThe textbook is: Forecasting: Principles and Practice by Rob J Hyndman and George Athanasopoulos – it is freely available online. Chapters 1-9.\n\n\nCourse Site and Moodle\nOur course will run from a combination of Moodle and the course website at https://stats-tgeorge.github.io/STA364_TSApps/.\n\n\nSoftware\nIn this course, we will use a combination of technologies, including R and RStudio (server). I have set up an RStudio server that you will access with a web browser. You don’t need to install any software (in fact, for a while, I prefer you don’t). If you are an off-campus student, please let me know right away.\nYou can access the RStudio Server at: http://turing.cornellcollege.edu:8787/.\nIf you have any technical problems you should contact IT as soon as possible. Submit a Work Order!\n\n\nGrades\nYou will find your grades in the course Moodle Gradebook.\n\nGrade Category Descriptions\n\nHomework:\nYour homework will be graded for correctness. I will generally evaluate a random subset of the assigned questions. Your goal is to practice the application of the method and be able to interpret the result. You will find your homework and due dates on the course website’s homepage.\n\n\nParticipation\nThis will be measured by your class attendance and your work on labs and class examples. With class work, please save your script files in the folder provided on the RServer. I will look at these files to see if you are following along and participating.\n\n\n\nProject\nYour project will entail multiple submission stages with details accessed through “Project” on the left side of the course website (once available). Some class time will be used for discussing projects, but not enough to complete the project. I do not anticipate we will start these until week 3. You must use time series analysis and write a scrollytelling article about your results. If you have never heard of scrollytelling, check out this NYT article and this shorthand website.\n\nExams\nYou will have two exams this block, 1/23 and 2/4-2/5. Each exam will have two components. Component 1 will be on these dates and be in a written format. Component 2 will be a take-home, open-book, open-note, exam that you will have 12 hours or more to complete.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssignment\nPoints\n\n\n\n\nHomework\n300\n\n\nParticipation\n100\n\n\nProject\n200\n\n\nExams, two 200pts exams\n400\n\n\nTotal\n1000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrade\nRange\nGrade\nRange\n\n\n\n\nA\n93-100%\nC\n73-76%\n\n\nA-\n90–92%\nC-\n70-72%\n\n\nB+\n87–89%\nD+\n67-69%\n\n\nB\n83-86%\nD\n63-66%\n\n\nB-\n80-82%\nD-\n60-62%\n\n\nC+\n77-79%\nF\n&lt;60%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCourse Policies\n\n\nAI Policy\nThe beta release of Dall-E-Mini in July 2022 and ChatGPT in November 2022 are among many tools using artificial intelligence. It is likely that using tools like these will become an important skill for careers in the not-too-distant future (https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jan/07/chatgpt-bot-excel-ai-chatbot-tech).\nIn the meantime, though, society will have to figure out when using these tools is acceptable.\nWork created by AI tools may not be considered original work and, instead, considered automated plagiarism. It is derived from previously created texts from other sources the models were trained on, yet doesn’t cite sources. AI models have built-in biases (ie, they are trained on limited underlying sources; they reproduce, rather than challenge, errors in the sources) AI tools have limitations (ie, they lack critical thinking to evaluate and reflect on criteria; they lack deductive reasoning to make judgments with incomplete information at hand; they make up or use inaccurate information and may “hallucinate” sources that do not exist)\nIn this course, all informal writing should be written without AI. The purpose of informal writing is to help you think through your ideas, connect with your lived experiences, and figure out your thoughts and opinions. Using AI here subverts that process.\nA final note: Other courses may have different AI policies, and it is important to be aware of each class’s policy.\n\n\nDISABILITIES AND ACCOMMODATIONS POLICY\nCornell College makes reasonable accommodations for persons with disabilities. Students should notify the Office of Academic Support and Advising and their course instructor of any disability-related accommodations within the first three days of the term for which the accommodations are required due to the fast pace of the block format. For more information on the documentation required to establish the need for accommodations and the process of requesting the accommodations.\n\n\nACADEMIC HONESTY POLICY\nCornell College expects all members of the Cornell community to act with academic integrity. An important aspect of academic integrity is respecting the work of others. A student is expected to explicitly acknowledge ideas, claims, observations, or data of others, unless generally known. When a piece of work is submitted for credit, a student is asserting that the submission is her or his work unless there is a citation of a specific source. If there is no appropriate acknowledgment of sources, whether intended or not, this may constitute a violation of the College’s requirement for honesty in academic work and may be treated as a case of academic dishonesty. The procedures regarding how the College deals with cases of academic dishonesty appear in The Catalog, under the heading “Academic Honesty.”\n\n\nIllness Policy\nIf you become unable to attend class for any other health reason, contact me as soon as possible.\n\n\nMandatory Reporter Reminder\nIt is my goal that you feel supported and able to share information related to your life experiences during classroom discussions, in your written work, and in any one-on-one meetings with me. You should also know that all Cornell College faculty and staff are mandatory reporters. This means that I will keep information you share with me private to the greatest extent possible. However, I am required to share information regarding sexual assault, abuse, criminal behavior, or about a student who may be a danger to themselves or to others. If you wish to speak to someone confidentially who is not a mandatory reporter, you can schedule an appointment with one of the counselors in the Ebersole Health and Wellbeing Center or contact the College Chaplain, Rev. Melea White, at mwhite@cornelllcollege.edu.",

Currently nearly 1% of GDP.\nThe total cost is budgeted based on forecasts of drug usage.\nCosts are disaggregated by drug type (ATC1 x15 / ATC2 84), concession category (x2) and patient type (x2), giving \\(84\\times2\\times2=336\\) time series."

(or help()) to find out about the data in each series.\nWhat is the time interval of each series?\nUse autoplot() to produce a time plot of each series.\nFor the last plot, modify the axis labels and title. See the labs() function.\n\n\n\nQuestion 2 (fpp3)\n\nCreate a data folder inside your STA364 project folder. Go to RStudio and navigate to your STA364Project folder in the files tab on the bottom right. Click New Folder and name the folder data.\nNow, you need to copy the data from the instructor data folder to a data folder in your folder. Go to the STA364_inst_files folder and into the data folder\nCheck the box next to tute.csv, then More, then Copy to…, and save the file in your newly created data folder.\n\nThe first chunk below reads tute1.csv into R and then shows the data with the View() function. You should find four columns of information. Columns B through D each contain a quarterly series labeled Sales, AdBudget, and GDP. Sales contains the quarterly sales for a small company over the period 1981-2005. AdBudget is the advertising budget, and GDP is the gross domestic product. All series have been adjusted for inflation.\nYou can read the data into R with the following script:\n\ntute1 &lt;- readr::read_csv(\"data/tute1.csv\")\nView(tute1)\n\nThen converts the data to a time series object in R (tsibble).\n\nmytimeseries &lt;- tute1 |&gt;\n  mutate(Quarter = yearquarter(Quarter)) |&gt;\n  as_tsibble(index = Quarter)\n\nThen construct the time series plot for the Sales series.\n\nmytimeseries |&gt;\n  autoplot(Sales)\n\n\nUse this code to generate a time series plot for the other two series in the data, AdBudget, and GDP.\nCompare and contrast the three series.\n\n\n\nQuestion 3 (fpp4)\nThe USgas package contains data on the demand for natural gas in the US.\n\nInstall the USgas package. (Use install.packages('package_name')). Then to use it you will need library(package_name).\nCreate a tsibble from us_total with year as the index and state as the key.\nPlot the annual natural gas consumption by state for the New England area (comprising the states of Maine, Vermont, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Connecticut and Rhode Island).\n\n\n\nQuestion 4 (fpp6)\nThe aus_arrivals data set comprises quarterly international arrivals to Australia from Japan, New Zealand, the UK, and the US. It is available after you call in the fpp3 package.\n\nUse autoplot(), gg_season() and gg_subseries() to compare the differences between the arrivals from these four countries.\nCan you identify any unusual observations?"
