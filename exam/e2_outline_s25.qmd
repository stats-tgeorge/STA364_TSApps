##### This in-class exam is worth `100 points`. The take-home is worth `100 points`.

### Outline

a.  Content in Exam 1 Outline [HERE](https://stats-tgeorge.github.io/STA364_TSApps/exam/e1_outline_s25.html).

b.  ETS Models

-   Smoothing models with trend
-   Smoothing models with seasonality
-   Identifying when to use multiplicative models vs additive models
-   Comparing models
-   How `ETS()` auto selection function works.
-   Given the forecast variance formula, $\hat{\sigma}_h$, calculate the prediction interval.

c.  ARIMA Models

-   Stationarity: Identify if a series is or is not stationary.
-   Differencing: What is it? What kinds? Why?
-   Backshift notation: What is it, and what does it do?
-   Autoregressive Models (AR): Conditions, how to fit, model equation.
-   Moving Average Models (MA): Conditions, how to fit, model equation.
-   ARIMA Models (*see below*): Write out the specific equation using the general equation and a ùëù,ùëë, and ùëû (small) identifying the orders ($p$ and $q$) by looking at a stationary series's correlogram and PACF plot.
-   SARIMA Models: Same as ARIMA but with a season piece.
-   ARIMA vs ETA
-   `ARIMA()` function default algorithm.

d.  Overall

-   Fitting and comparing models on a test set
-   Forecasting with all models

#### ARIMA Process

1.  Plot the data. Identify any unusual observations.

2.  If necessary, transform the data (using a Box-Cox transformation) to stabilize the variance.

3.  If the data are non-stationary: take first differences of the data until the data are stationary.

4.  Examine the ACF/PACF (**of the stationary series**): Is an AR($p$) or MA($q$) model appropriate?

  a.  **AR(**$p$): We have an AR($p$) model when
  
  -   the ACF is exponentially decaying or sinusoidal
  -   there is a significant spike at lag $p$ in **PACF**, but none beyond $p$

  b.  **MA(**$q$): We have an MA($q$) model when
  
  -   the PACF is exponentially decaying or sinusoidal
  -   there is a significant spike at lag $q$ in **ACF**, but none beyond $q$

5.  Try your chosen model(s), and use the *AICc* to search for a better model.

6.  Check the residuals from your chosen model by plotting the ACF of the residuals, and doing a portmanteau test of the residuals. If they do not look like white noise, try a modified model.

7.  Once the residuals look like white noise, calculate forecasts.
