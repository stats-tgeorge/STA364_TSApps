This is your template document. 

Let's start a *Closeread* section.

:::{.cr-section}
Everything will be in this format, left to right until we end the section.

Let's define a stick, in this case, to see features, we will define a sticky that is a block of text from the tutorial. 

| {#cr-student_sd_poem}
| Once was a student
| who ate sourdough for dinner.
| Upon their waking 
| their own tummy was quaking 
| as the bread was bad.

Everything will be in this format, left to right until we end the section. 

Let's call the whole sticky with @cr-student_sd_poem. 


We want to see scaling, panning, zooming, highlighting, 

Scaling to .5: [@cr-student_sd_poem]{scale-by=".5"}

Zooming: [@cr-student_sd_poem]{zoom-to="4"}

Highlighting: [@cr-student_sd_poem]{highlight="4"}

Highlighting and Zoom: [@cr-student_sd_poem]{hlz="4"}


Next, I want to pan but need an image. 

Define a sticky with an image. This image was taken from `allrecipies.com` and an article by John Mitzewhich. 


:::{#cr-image_ex}
![](sourdough.png)
:::


Now we can try panning. First let's see the image with no panning: @cr-image_ex.

And pan, 25% in from the left and 50% in from the bottom: [@cr-image_ex]{pan-to="25%,-50%"}

Then you can have ending text too! This text is the full width of the page.
